I need help understanding why this happens ### Why my brain like this? I was pretty shit mentally for three months and now this week it feels like I've walked it off. It's like a switch flips and I forget about it. The biggest issue I had was insomnia and sleep gotten easier I'm hoping still lol. But yeah not it generally feels like my brain will have depressive phases and then just walk it off sometimes I do have a history of family abuse had difficulties with bad family history growing up, I still hate taljing to my biological dad even though we have a good relationship my family on more the complicated big family type of family. And of course bullying social isolation issues.
Wish I could sleep forever. ### I don’t do anything, I constantly overthink, I feel like everybody hates me no matter how much they tell me otherwise, I’m such a loser. Everything is getting old and boring, suicidal thoughts went away for a bit, but now they’re back and I’m not sure what to do, binge watching shows/movies doesn’t work anymore, honestly for a second I thought I was getting better, guess not. It’s not even like my life is terrible, I have a wonderful girlfriend, food and shelter, all the entertainment I could possibly need, so why do I still feel so empty? - why is it so hard to be happy and not want to end it all. I just want to sleep but it feels impossible thanks to my insomnia.

Counting sheep isn't working anymore. I'm so exhausted, but my brain just won't shut off. It's like my mind is replaying every bad thing I've ever done on repeat.
The darkness outside feels like a reflection of the darkness inside. Every time I close my eyes, it's like I'm drowning in a sea of my own thoughts. Sleep seems so far away.
Another night staring at the ceiling. My mind is racing with anxieties and regrets. I'm so tired, but sleep is just an elusive dream.
The only thing keeping me company is the ticking of the clock. It feels like every second is an eternity when you can't fall asleep. I just want to escape this cycle of insomnia and despair.
I'm trapped in a waking nightmare. I know I need to rest, but every time I try to sleep, I'm bombarded with negativity. It's like my brain is constantly fighting against me.
The hours crawl by like a snail. My body is aching for sleep, but my mind is stuck in overdrive. I can feel the exhaustion creeping in, but I can't seem to surrender to it.
The silence amplifies the noise in my head. My thoughts are like a hurricane, swirling around me endlessly. I feel like I'm going crazy from lack of sleep.
I'm so tired of being tired. This constant battle with insomnia is draining my energy. I feel like I'm just existing, not truly living.
I'm yearning for a moment of peace, but my mind won't let me find it. Every night is a torment, a constant struggle to find oblivion.
Sleep used to be my escape, but now it feels like a cruel joke. I just want to feel the weight of the world lift from my shoulders, but my insomnia keeps me tethered to the ground.

Example:
I think my mental health is just killing me slowly : All the time I've lost to this disease, the contribution it's made to awful sleep, insomnia, and bad health in general. I wonder how many days, or how much time it's stolen and continuing to steal from my life? Do I get to suffer for decades and then die early too, maybe when it's just starting to be light. I'm really not sure. It sucks having problems that damage your mind thrust into your life that are beyond your control. I was pretty normal, and I don't know I'll ever get close to it again. It's such a long and painful journey that no one sees, and no one understands.

It's like my brain is on overdrive, replaying every mistake and every failure over and over again. I'm so exhausted, but I can't seem to switch off. It feels like I'm trapped in a constant cycle of worry and dread.
The silence of the night is deafening. Every creak of the house, every tick of the clock, becomes a reminder of my own emptiness. I'm surrounded by darkness, both outside and within.
The clock taunts me. Every minute that passes without sleep is a minute closer to the dawn, a minute closer to facing another day of this relentless struggle. I just want to disappear, to escape this agonizing reality.
I used to love the feeling of falling asleep. Now it feels like a distant memory. I crave it so desperately, but it always seems just out of reach. It's like a cruel joke, a constant reminder of my own powerlessness.
My mind is a battlefield, a constant war between sleep and the relentless thoughts that plague me. Every time I think I'm finally drifting off, I'm jolted back to reality by another wave of anxiety or self-doubt. It's a never-ending cycle of torture.
I'm so tired of fighting. The battle against insomnia feels like a Sisyphean task. I push a boulder uphill every night, only to watch it roll back down again. It's exhausting and demoralizing.
I'm trapped in a waking nightmare. I'm so tired, both physically and emotionally, but sleep remains an elusive dream. I feel like a prisoner in my own mind, unable to escape the darkness that consumes me.
This insomnia is like a physical manifestation of my depression. It's a constant reminder of my brokenness, of my inability to find peace. I feel like I'm slowly fading away, consumed by this darkness.
Every night feels like an eternity. I count the hours, each one a torment. I long for the sweet relief of sleep, but it never seems to come. It's a cruel irony, that the very thing that could help me feel better is the one thing I can't seem to achieve.
I feel like I'm losing myself to this insomnia. My body is exhausted, my mind is racing, and my spirit is slowly fading. I'm losing hope, losing the will to fight. I just want to disappear, to find peace in the oblivion of sleep, but it feels so far away.

Insomnia +phenergan : Recently I’ve been unmedicated for depression, and honestly I think it is better for me than previously on SSRIs. However I am again experiencing severe sleep problems, I frequently go the whole night without sleep. I have been given 50mg to take before bed, but despite making me feel drowsy, I still find my mind fully awake and struggling to sleep.
Please help: Severe insomnia affecting me in many ways : So I've been really down recently for multiple reasons: my BDD, depression, anxiety all struck back at the same time and at first, I was just sleeping late coz I couldn't fall asleep but then it escalated to sleeping when the sun's up and waking when it's dark. I've got assignments and online classes going on and a long list of lectures to listen to in a subject I absolutely hate. I eat two meals a day since I wake up at odd hours (sometimes 6pm, sometimes 1pm, sometimes 4pm) and my body can't adjust to my sleep schedule. I feel worse ever since I've gotten this serious insomnia because not only does it make me feel horrible for not being able to sleep when I'm sad and tired, it's preventing me from being a physically healthy person. I've had a Napoleon complex for too long and my father told me our family has always been a long line of late bloomers. I really need the sleep and the food to grow. But I just can't have them. When I wake up, it's always to sit in front of my laptop and listen to lectures I hate listening to at 2x speed and 0 comprehension. Recently, my vision definitely got worse and my hair is falling out too. My brain can't seem to function well I'm misreading stuff and making simple grammatical mistakes in my writing/daily convo. Someone please help, what is wrong with me? I just want to be happy, healthy and normal.

My mind is a constant race track. Even with medication, I'm stuck on the hamster wheel, thoughts spinning and anxieties building. I feel physically drained but mentally wide awake, which is the worst kind of exhaustion.
I'm a zombie during the day. The lack of sleep makes everything harder - work, relationships, even basic self-care. It feels like I'm constantly swimming upstream, fighting against the current of fatigue and despair.
Sleep used to be my sanctuary, but now it's a battlefield. I'm constantly battling against my racing thoughts, the dread, and the overwhelming sense of hopelessness. It's a vicious cycle: the lack of sleep fuels the depression, and the depression makes it harder to sleep.
I'm so tired of being tired. I feel like I'm living in a constant fog, unable to focus or function properly. The lack of sleep is making it impossible to see any light at the end of the tunnel.
I'm starting to feel like I'm losing my grip on reality. My mind is playing tricks on me, and I'm struggling to discern what's real and what's not. The insomnia is making everything feel heightened and distorted, and I'm starting to lose hope that I'll ever be able to escape this nightmare.
I've tried everything to fall asleep - meditation, herbal teas, even counting sheep. Nothing seems to work. I'm starting to feel like I'm going crazy, trapped in this endless cycle of wakefulness and despair.
My body is begging for rest, but my mind won't let me sleep. It's like there's a constant internal struggle going on, a battle between my physical needs and the anxieties that keep me awake.
It's like my brain is stuck on replay, constantly revisiting past mistakes and regrets. Every time I close my eyes, I'm flooded with images and thoughts that make it impossible to fall asleep.
The darkness outside mirrors the darkness within. I feel so alone in my struggle, like no one understands the torment of insomnia and its connection to my depression. It feels like I'm trapped in a never-ending night, with no hope of dawn.
I'm starting to lose hope that I'll ever be able to sleep normally again. The insomnia feels like an insurmountable hurdle, an endless obstacle in my path to recovery. It's draining my energy, my motivation, and my will to fight.

Sleeping my life away ### I fumble through my work week BARELY. Then I go to bed for 3 days. The only time I’m somewhat happy is when I’m asleep. I even prefer the nightmares to being awake. I’m on antidepressants and have tried them all or many of. I’m TIRED, so damned tired…
Literally zero energy : I sleep like 12 hours a day, I have been on antidepressants for about 4 months, I have stopped going to college and miss shifts, help?

Here are 10 comments about the struggles of hypersomnia related to depression:
I feel like I'm drowning in sleep. I wake up feeling even more exhausted than when I went to bed. It's a vicious cycle of endless fatigue, and I can't seem to break free.
My body is constantly craving rest, but my mind feels heavy and unmotivated. It's like I'm stuck in a state of perpetual hibernation, unable to shake off the overwhelming lethargy.
I'm losing track of time. Days blur into weeks, and I feel like I'm sleepwalking through my life. I'm missing out on opportunities and experiences, but I just can't seem to summon the energy to participate.
The guilt is crippling. I know I should be doing more, but my body just won't cooperate. I feel like I'm letting everyone down, including myself.
I'm scared of what I'm becoming. This hypersomnia is taking over my life, and I'm afraid I'll never be able to escape its grasp. It feels like I'm slowly fading away, trapped in a state of perpetual sleepiness.
I'm losing touch with reality. The world seems distant and hazy, and I'm struggling to connect with the people around me. I feel like I'm slipping away, lost in a sea of drowsiness.
Even small tasks feel like monumental efforts. I'm constantly battling against the overwhelming fatigue, trying to push myself to do even the simplest things. But it's an uphill battle, and I often find myself giving up before I even start.
I'm so frustrated with myself. I want to be more productive, more engaged, but I just can't seem to overcome this relentless sleepiness. I feel like I'm failing myself, failing my dreams, and failing the people who care about me.
This hypersomnia feels like a physical manifestation of my depression. It's a constant reminder of my powerlessness, my inability to control my own body and my own life.
I'm afraid that I'll never be able to escape this sleepiness. It feels like a prison, trapping me in a state of perpetual lethargy and despair. I'm starting to lose hope that I'll ever feel like myself again.

When asked... What are your hobbies? How do you find hobbies in your depression? : Ummm sleep. I haven’t had hobbies I actually enjoy in so long so I just lie and say what I did in high school. I’ll go out and try those things alone as I have nobody to go with and I always end up having a dreadful time. How do you find new hobbies in your depression?
I haven't had a genuine interest in 10 years : I don't know if this is a common symptom of depression or not but I can't do anything. And I mean anything. I want to have a hobby, I want to enjoy things but I just can't. I can't even watch Netflix without wanting to just turn it off and go to sleep. I don't even want to sleep, I just want to not be bored anymore. I don't know what to do and I can't function anymore, if I can't enjoy my time away from work then I don't know why I'm alive anymore.

I used to be so passionate about [hobby], but now it just feels like a chore. The joy has been sucked out of it, and I can't seem to muster up any enthusiasm. It's like a part of me has died.
I'm surrounded by things I used to love, but they hold no appeal anymore. My guitar sits in the corner collecting dust, my paints are untouched, and my books gather on the shelf. I feel like I'm losing myself, one forgotten hobby at a time.
The thought of pursuing any kind of hobby makes me feel exhausted. I just don't have the energy or the motivation. It feels like a monumental task, even something as simple as reading a book or watching a movie.
I feel like I'm drifting through life without any purpose. I used to find fulfillment in my hobbies, but now I just feel empty and directionless. It's like I've lost my identity.
I envy people who can find joy in simple things. The idea of having a hobby, something that brings them pleasure and fulfillment, feels like a distant dream. It's a constant reminder of the emptiness I feel inside.
I'm afraid that I'll never be able to enjoy my hobbies again. It's like the spark has been extinguished, and I'm not sure if it will ever be rekindled. It's a terrifying thought.
I'm trying to force myself to pick up my old hobbies, but it feels like a hollow imitation of my former self. I can't seem to find the same joy, the same passion, and it's deeply disheartening.
I'm losing myself in the monotony of everyday life. Without my hobbies, there's no escape, no outlet for my creativity or my emotions. I'm feeling trapped in a cycle of boredom and despair.
I feel like a shell of my former self. I'm losing the things that used to define me, the things that made me feel alive. It's like I'm slowly fading away, losing myself in the fog of depression.
I'm scared to even try new hobbies, because I'm afraid of failing. The thought of pouring my heart and soul into something only to have it fall flat is too much to bear. It feels like I'm setting myself up for disappointment.

I used to live for [hobby], but now it just feels like a chore. I can't even look at my [equipment/materials] without feeling a wave of dread. It's like the joy has been sucked out of it, and I just don't care anymore.
My bookshelf is full of unread books, my art supplies are gathering dust, and my guitar hasn't been touched in months. Everything I used to love just feels pointless. I'm like a ghost of my former self.
The thought of doing anything fun or engaging makes me feel like a lead weight is in my stomach. I used to be so full of energy and ideas, but now all I want to do is lie in bed and stare at the ceiling. It's like all the color has drained out of my life.
I used to find so much fulfillment in my [hobby], but now it just feels empty. It's like I'm going through the motions without any real connection to it. I feel like I'm losing myself.

LOSS OF INTEREST IN SEX AND PHYSICAL INTIMACY

The comments must only include the theme of loss of interest in sex and physical touch. Use the following examples as a guide in terms of length and theme.
Examples:
Considering Lamictal / lamotrigine, but drugs have never done anything for me. ### I have gone through so many meds for depression and I've never had one where I could definitively see a positive impact. My prescriber suggested Lamictal and I don't feel like it's worth trying because nothing else has ever helped my mood. I'm also concerned about the side effects. Prescriber downplays them but I know everyone is different. Esp paranoid about sexual side effects because of my experience with SSRIs (I know Lamictal isn't an SSRI tho). Has anyone here had success with Lamictal after nothing else did any good? Trying to make a decision here and I keep holding out hope that something will change but after 30+ years I just want to give up.
For those of you whose partner has been taking antidepressants: - How long have they been on meds for? - Did antidepressants help your partner? - Did antidepressants help your relationship? What were the effects? (I know this is a selfish question; but I have to ask) What improved, what got worse? Sex, mood, feelings of isolation, you name it.

I used to crave physical intimacy, but now it just feels like a chore. Even the idea of being touched makes me feel uncomfortable, like a violation. It's like the spark has been extinguished, and I don't know if it will ever be rekindled.
My partner is getting frustrated, but I just can't seem to muster up any desire. I feel like a failure, like I'm not good enough. I hate feeling like I'm letting them down, but I can't force myself to feel something I don't.
I'm afraid I'm pushing my partner away. They deserve someone who wants them, who craves their touch. But I'm so stuck in this fog of apathy, I can't seem to break free.
I'm starting to feel like I'm losing a part of myself. Sex used to be a source of pleasure and connection, but now it just feels like another symptom of my depression. I'm afraid of losing myself completely.
I'm trying to talk to my doctor about it, but I'm scared to admit how bad it's gotten. I feel like I'm failing, like I'm not doing enough to fix this. It's a vicious cycle of shame and avoidance.
The thought of sex makes me feel anxious and overwhelmed. It's like a reminder of everything that's wrong with me, everything I'm not able to do or enjoy. It just adds to the feeling of despair.
I'm afraid of hurting my partner. I know they love me and want to be close to me, but I can't seem to reciprocate. It feels like I'm betraying them, even though it's not intentional.
I'm losing hope that I'll ever feel like myself again. The loss of interest in sex and physical touch feels like a permanent part of my depression. It's like I'm trapped in a body that doesn't belong to me.
It's not just about sex, it's about the feeling of connection. I used to crave physical closeness, but now even a hug feels like a burden. I'm afraid I'm losing the ability to connect with anyone on a physical level.
I feel like I'm failing at being a partner. I know that intimacy is an important part of a relationship, but I just can't seem to deliver. It's like I'm broken, and I don't know how to fix it.

I miss the person she is when she isn't depressed. I miss being able to make her laugh. I miss the positive regard of my own self that comes from vibing so much with her and us having fun together and her liking me. She is so easily irritated with me these days, in ways I don't feel I deserve. I miss meeting her in that connected place that we go to during sex. I miss our sex. I feel so anxious because of how emotionally unresponsive she is. I feel hurt and angry and want to also shut down/pull away in protest, but realize that hurting her won't bring her back and then I just feel helpless.
How has your partners depression affected your sex life? How do you deal with it? How do you talk about it? How do you feel about it? As a wife I’m struggling a lot but I don’t want to be insensitive.
Can’t bring myself out of isolation ### I’ve completely lost my confidence. I used to be fun at parties. I used to meet my friends all the time. I used to be flirty and have a lot of random sex. Now i’m just at home isolating everyday and just rotting year after year. I can’t bring myself out of it.

It's like the spark just went out. I used to crave my partner's touch, but now I just feel numb. I hate that I'm not able to be the person they deserve, the person they fell in love with. It feels like a betrayal, even though it's not intentional.
I'm afraid to initiate intimacy, because I don't want to be rejected. The thought of being turned down just makes me feel worse, like I'm even more worthless. It's a vicious cycle of fear and avoidance.
I miss the feeling of connection. I miss the way my partner used to look at me, the way they'd touch me with such tenderness. Now, it feels like we're living in separate worlds, two ships passing in the night.
I'm afraid this loss of desire is a sign that something is wrong with me, that I'm not good enough. It feels like I'm failing at being a partner, failing at being a person. It's a heavy burden to carry.
I'm trying to be understanding, but it's hard. I miss the intimacy we used to share, the closeness and connection. I feel like I'm losing a part of myself, and I don't know how to get it back.
I'm worried this is going to drive a wedge between us. It feels like our intimacy is a battlefield, a constant reminder of the distance that's grown between us. I'm afraid we're drifting apart.
I'm starting to feel hopeless. I don't know if things will ever be the same again. It feels like this loss of desire is a permanent part of my depression, and I don't know how to escape it.
I feel like I'm failing at being a partner. I know intimacy is important, but I just can't seem to muster up the energy or the desire. It's like I'm a ghost in my own body, unable to connect with my partner on a physical level.
I'm afraid I'm hurting my partner, even though I don't mean to. They're trying to be understanding, but I can feel the frustration building. I'm afraid of losing them, of losing everything because of my depression.
I just want to feel normal again, to feel like myself again. I miss the way I used to feel about intimacy, the way it used to bring us closer together. But it feels like a distant memory, a dream I can't seem to reach.

Example:
Hypersexuality as a coping mechanism : Hi. I hope this isn't too forward a question or inappropriate.
Have any you had problems with hypersexuality as a coping mechanism for your depression? I'll be honest and admit I masturbate way way way too much, watch way too much porn etc for those short bursts of dopamine it triggers in my brain.
I can't tell if it's perhaps a coping mechanism or not but I at times have next to no sexual desire or fantasies during but just do it out of habit, probably because of the dopamine it triggers (which in return leaves me even more depressed, shameful and exhausted afterwards).
Does anyone else have a problem like this or can relate? I mean; By all measures hypersexuality and depression doesn't sound like it mixes well but I have this idea it might be the case for me.

Model
Here are 5 comments about the struggles of hypersexuality related to depression:
It's like a vicious cycle. I use sex as a way to escape my depression, but it only makes me feel worse in the long run. The shame and guilt afterwards are overwhelming, and I feel even more empty and hopeless.
I can't seem to control it. The urge is so intense, it's like a force outside of me. I know it's not healthy, but I can't seem to stop. It feels like I'm trapped in a cage of my own making.
I'm afraid to talk to anyone about it. I'm ashamed of my behavior, and I don't want to be judged. It's like a dirty secret that I'm carrying around, and it weighs on me constantly.
I feel like I'm losing myself. I used to be able to find pleasure in other things, but now it's all about sex. It's like my whole life is revolving around this one thing, and it's not healthy.
I'm starting to feel hopeless. I don't know how to break free from this cycle of hypersexuality and depression. It feels like I'm trapped, and I don't know how to get out.

Examples:
-How can I deal with loneliness? ### I feel so lonely all the time. I have little to no friends and my coworkers don't like me. I don't have a girlfriend. In fact in 27 years of life I only had a short long-distance relationship (when I was 26). Now I'm single and I'm sad cause I'm stuck in a small town where I can't seem to meet people my age ( none who are single anyway). I have very strong romantic desires/needs (I want hugs and kisses, mostly) and it drives me crazy. Im so jealous of all the couples I see lol even my friends (or maybe especially my friends, since I know how wild their sex life is)
-"I feel a bit trapped : I dont know if im depressed, probably not but oh boy sometimes I wonder. Its not like I can't get out of bed, or am not functional. But for the past few years ive been so alone. I want to angrily vomit, scream, cry, I don't know, i always feel so stupif, i cant explain it. Especially when somone does somthing for me, I just feel stupid. There is ample evidence of it in my family.
What brought me here was I just realized that Im all alone in the world with nobody to talk to about my feelings. And now I just want somome to weep shamelessly on. I have close friends, but im scared. I'm terrified, all my life I never let myself be vulnrable like that. And the few times I did, it didn't go well. Mayne I was doing it wrong and its my fault idk. I'm so jelous of people who can just talk about thejr emotional turmoil to their friends. I certainly don't think other people are weak when they do it, but when I do it, I'm weak. I don't want anyone to ""save me"", I just wanna let loose for once."

It's like I'm living in a silent movie. Everyone else is laughing, talking, and connecting, but I'm just watching from the sidelines, unable to participate. I feel like a ghost, invisible and unheard.
I'm surrounded by people, but I feel so alone. I crave connection, but it feels impossible to reach out. I'm afraid of being rejected, of being seen as a burden. So I just retreat further into myself.
I long for a hug, a simple act of affection, but it feels so far away. I'm surrounded by people who love me, but I can't seem to let them in. I'm afraid of being vulnerable, of showing my true self.
The silence is deafening. I miss the sound of laughter, the feeling of being part of a conversation. I miss having someone to share my thoughts and feelings with, someone who understands.
I'm afraid of becoming a hermit. I don't want to spend the rest of my life alone, but I don't know how to break out of this cycle of loneliness and isolation. It feels like I'm sinking deeper and deeper into despair.
I feel like a burden to everyone around me. I know they care, but I can't help but feel like I'm dragging them down with me. It's easier to just push them away, to keep my distance.
I envy people who have close friends and family. It seems so simple for them, but for me, it's an impossible dream. I'm constantly surrounded by reminders of my own loneliness, and it's heartbreaking.
I'm afraid I'll never find someone who can truly understand me, someone who can accept me for who I am. I'm afraid of being alone for the rest of my life, of never feeling truly connected to another person.
I'm so tired of feeling like a shadow. I want to be seen, to be heard, to be loved. But I don't know how to make that happen. It feels like I'm trapped in a cycle of loneliness and despair.
I'm losing hope that things will ever change. It's like I'm living in a perpetual twilight zone, trapped in a world of isolation and heartache. I'm starting to feel like this is my fate, my destiny. It's a terrifying thought.

Here are 10 comments about the struggles of sadness related to depression:
It's like a heavy weight on my chest, a constant ache in my soul. I can't shake this feeling of sadness, no matter how hard I try. It's like a dark cloud that follows me everywhere.
I used to find joy in simple things, but now everything feels muted. Colors seem less vibrant, laughter sounds hollow, and even the things I used to love just leave me feeling empty.
I feel like I'm drowning in a sea of sorrow. Every wave of sadness pulls me further down, and I can't seem to find a way back to the surface. It's like I'm losing the ability to feel anything but this crushing despair.
I'm so tired of crying. My tears have run dry, but the sadness remains. It's a constant ache in my heart, a gnawing emptiness that I can't seem to fill.
I'm afraid to let myself feel happy. It feels like a betrayal, like I'm disrespecting the sadness that consumes me. I'm so used to feeling down that even a flicker of joy feels out of place.
It's like I'm living in a perpetual twilight zone. The world feels gray and lifeless, and even the smallest joys feel fleeting and insignificant. I can't seem to find any real sense of purpose or meaning.
I'm starting to lose hope that I'll ever feel happy again. The sadness feels so pervasive, so all-encompassing, that it's hard to imagine a life without it. It's like I'm living in a constant state of mourning.
I feel like I'm burdening everyone around me. My sadness feels like a dark cloud that follows me everywhere, and I'm afraid I'm casting a shadow on everyone who comes into my life.
I'm so tired of being tired. This sadness is draining me, stealing my energy and my motivation. I just want to feel something, anything, other than this crushing despair.
I'm afraid to let myself hope for a better future. It feels like I'm setting myself up for disappointment. The sadness feels so real, so constant, that I'm starting to believe it's all I'll ever know. It's a terrifying thought.

Example:
-> Lather, rinse, and repeat : I've really been a depressive since the age of 12 (now 25). In my late teens, my anxiety became too much to handle and I reluctantly jumped on the psych med merry-go-round. I used SSRIs for a couple years and experienced some benefit, though never achieved full remission. Due to the emotional blunting, sexual dysfunction, among other side effects, I decided to quit.
~ 4 years later, I'm still fucked up from the drugs. I suffer from anhedonia, decreased libido, head pressure, among other symptoms. The original anxiety is still present -- perhaps more so -- with an additional later of drug-induced depression added to the mix.
I've been trying to live as ""normally"" as possible with thes lasting side-effects, but I'm effectively faking my way through life. I'm in graduate school to kill some time, but I enjoy very little. Everything feels full and meaningless.
Every time I wake up, the first thought is ""not again.""
How many times must I repeat this draining, joyless day?
They say you have to play the hand you're dealt in life. When is it time to fold?

Here are 10 comments about the struggles of emptiness related to depression:
It's like I'm living in a black and white world. Colors have lost their vibrancy, and even the things I used to love no longer bring me joy. Everything feels empty, hollow, and meaningless.
I feel like a ghost in my own life. I'm going through the motions, but I'm not truly present. I'm just a shell, a vacant vessel with no real sense of self or purpose.
I'm surrounded by people who love me, but I can't seem to connect with them. It's like I'm trapped in a glass box, watching them live their lives while I'm frozen in a state of emotional numbness.
I'm afraid to let myself hope for anything. The thought of feeling joy again seems like a betrayal, a mockery of the emptiness I feel inside. It's easier to just accept that this is my fate, my reality.
I'm so tired of trying to fill the void. I've tried everything – hobbies, relationships, travel – but nothing seems to work. The emptiness is always there, lurking beneath the surface, ready to swallow me whole.
The thought of spending the rest of my life like this is terrifying. I don't want to just exist, I want to truly live. But I'm starting to lose hope that it's even possible.
I feel like I'm slowly fading away, like I'm losing myself to the emptiness. I don't recognize the person I've become, and I'm afraid that I'll never get myself back.
It's like my heart is made of stone. I can't feel anything, not love, not joy, not even sadness. Just this overwhelming sense of emptiness that consumes me entirely.
I'm afraid to reach out for help. I don't want to burden anyone with my emptiness, my despair. It feels like I'm a broken record, repeating the same sad story over and over again.
I'm starting to believe that this is all I'll ever know. The emptiness is becoming my reality, my truth. It's a terrifying thought, but it's also the one that feels most real.

The comments must only include the theme of worthlessness. Use the following examples as a guide in terms of length and theme.
Examples:
Is it even possible to get hot at my age or am I wasting my time on an old antique that no one will want? ### That’s mostly a rhetorical question. I’m losing weight and slowly seeing a body that maybe could be desirable one day. Still have a loooooong way to go, but slowly, it’s happening. But I wonder sometimes if I’m wasting my time. Like who’s actually going to want this? I’ve never even been hot, why am I expecting that to change past my prime? The one thing I have going for me is that I’m a virgin but I get that being a red flag for an old hag and according to many, it doesn’t really count as valuable if you’re old and ugly lol
I want to improve my self worth ### I just wish that I could look at myself and see someone that is deserving of love and of life. I always feel like I am a waste of space and that I shouldn't even try. My whole life I have always felt like I was nothing in comparison to others. People tell me that I am beautiful and I am talented, but it is hard to see what others see. I don't see a person that deserves to be happy and deserves to live a fulfilling and full life. If you have acknowledged that you truly do not love yourself and that you really dislike yourself, where do you go from there? Like I really just don't know. It is hard to find the motivation to do anything when you actively dislike everything about yourself and who you are internally.

Here are 10 comments about the struggles of worthlessness related to depression:
I feel like a burden to everyone around me. I'm constantly dragging them down with my negativity, my lack of motivation, my inability to contribute. I'm a drain on their energy, their time, their love.
I'm afraid to ask for help. I don't deserve it. I'm not worthy of anyone's time or attention. I'm just a failure, a disappointment, a waste of space.
The thought of being happy, of feeling loved, feels like a cruel joke. I'm not worthy of those things. I'm not deserving of love, of joy, of anything good.
I'm surrounded by people who love me, but I can't seem to believe them. Their words of affirmation feel hollow, like empty promises. I know they care, but I just can't seem to believe in my own worth.
It's like I'm living in a constant state of self-loathing. I can't seem to escape the negative thoughts that plague me. I'm a failure, I'm ugly, I'm worthless. These words echo in my mind constantly, a relentless chorus of negativity.
I'm afraid of the future. I don't see a place for myself in it. I'm not worthy of success, of happiness, of love. I'm just destined to be alone, to fail, to be a burden on everyone around me.
I feel like I'm shrinking, like I'm losing myself to this feeling of worthlessness. My self-esteem is crumbling, and I'm starting to believe that I'm truly nothing.
The thought of trying to improve myself feels pointless. I'm not worthy of change, of growth, of self-improvement. I'm just a broken, irredeemable mess.
I'm so tired of fighting. It feels like I'm swimming upstream, constantly battling against this overwhelming sense of worthlessness. I'm starting to lose hope that I'll ever break free.
I'm afraid to hope for anything better. It feels like I'm setting myself up for disappointment. I'm destined to be a failure, a disappointment, a burden on the world. And I'm starting to accept it.

Example:
Advice? : I think I may have depression, but i’m not quite sure. Ever since September and starting a new year in school I’ve just gotten continually worse and worse. I don’t have the motivation for anything, I feel like nothing I do is good enough for anybody. The tiniest things can make me angry and snap at other people which is the worst because i’m taking it out on others. I’m tired all of the time, and I spend most of my days at school by myself. I want to go back to the person that I was in summer but it feels like I have so many things to worry about and I just cannot cope with them all even though it seems like other people can which is making it even worse. It’s not like I don’t want to get better because I do I just don’t know where to start.

Here are 10 comments about the struggles of anger and irritability related to depression:
I'm a ticking time bomb. The smallest things set me off, and I snap at everyone around me. I hate that I'm taking it out on the people I love, but I can't seem to control it. It's like the anger is bubbling up inside of me, and I'm just waiting to explode.
I'm so irritable, I'm surprised anyone can stand to be around me. I snap at my partner, my friends, my family. I feel like a monster, a burden to everyone who knows me.
This anger is so confusing. I don't even know why I'm so upset. It's like I'm constantly on edge, waiting for something bad to happen. And when it doesn't, I still feel this simmering rage beneath the surface.
I'm afraid to talk to anyone about it. I feel like I'm a burden, like I'm going to scare people away. It's easier to just keep it bottled up inside, to pretend everything is okay. But it's eating me alive.
I hate that I'm pushing away the people I care about. I know I'm not being a good friend, a good partner, a good person. But I can't seem to help it. This anger is consuming me, and it's turning me into someone I don't even recognize.
The guilt is unbearable. I feel so bad for snapping at the people I love. I know I'm hurting them, and I hate myself for it. But I can't seem to stop. It's like I'm trapped in a cycle of anger and regret.
I'm afraid of what this anger will do to me. It feels like it's taking over, consuming me. I'm afraid it will destroy my relationships, my career, my life.
This anger feels like a physical manifestation of my depression. It's like my body is trying to scream out the pain I can't express. I feel like I'm trapped in a cage of my own making, a prison of anger and despair.
I'm starting to feel hopeless. I don't know how to control this anger, how to break free from its grip. It feels like a permanent part of me, a defining characteristic of my depression.
I'm afraid of what the future holds. If I can't overcome this anger, how can I expect to have healthy relationships, a successful career, a happy life? It's a terrifying thought, but it's one that I can't seem to shake.

Examples:
"How do you get through work with depression amd anxiety? : I am dealing with a very bad spell of depression and anxiety the past couple weeks. To the point where I am waking up in a panic, covered in sweat. I managed to pick up extra hours at work right before the depression hit. Now it's time to go work those extra hours but I am too messed up to do anything. What do I do? I would feel horrible calling out of work because they gave those extra hours to me (they could have gave them to 3 other people but i happened to have been present when my manager was giving out hours) but I am not in a good state to do anything. It has been the worst week I have had in a while. I'm afraid of having a mental breakdown at work. I feel one coming."
What is happening to me ? I feel like I’m getting worse : I’m on sertraline and cymbalta.
The last few days I’ve felt worse than ever. I am crying over EVERYTHING , I’m hating my life, everything is giving me anxiety attacks and I had the worst panic attack of my entire life yesterday.
I’m back in therapy which is great since my last therapist unexpectedly died , I like my new one and our first session was nearly 2 hours .. I see her again in 2 weeks.
But I don’t understand what’s going on with me . It’s like my meds have stopped working as of two days ago. Has this happened to anyone before ? I haven’t cried this much in 4 years. I’m so sad and angry and I don’t even know why.
I feel so alone.

Here are 10 comments about the struggles of anxiety related to depression:
It's like I'm constantly on edge, waiting for the other shoe to drop. Every noise, every text, every email sends my heart racing. I can't seem to relax, even for a moment. It's exhausting, and it's making me feel like I'm going crazy.
My mind is a constant whirlwind of worry. What if I said the wrong thing? What if I didn't do enough? What if something bad happens? The questions never stop, and the anxiety just keeps building and building.
I'm afraid to leave the house. Every social interaction feels like a potential minefield of anxiety. What if I say something stupid? What if people judge me? It's easier to just stay home and avoid the world altogether.
I feel like I'm losing control. My heart is pounding, my breathing is shallow, my thoughts are racing. It's like a physical manifestation of my fear, and I can't seem to calm down.
I'm afraid to tell anyone how I feel. I don't want to burden them with my anxieties, my fears. It's easier to just pretend that I'm okay, but the anxiety is eating me alive.
It's like I'm living in a constant state of fight-or-flight. My body is always on high alert, ready to run at the slightest provocation. Even the simplest tasks feel overwhelming, and I just want to escape.
I'm so tired of feeling this way. The anxiety is draining me, taking away my joy, my energy, my motivation. I just want to feel calm, to feel safe, to feel normal.
I'm afraid that this anxiety will never go away. It's becoming a part of me, a defining characteristic of my existence. I'm afraid that I'll never be able to live a normal life, a happy life.
I'm losing hope that anything will ever get better. The anxiety feels so pervasive, so all-encompassing, that it's hard to imagine a life without it. It's like I'm trapped in a never-ending cycle of fear and worry.
I'm afraid of the future. What if this anxiety just gets worse? What if I lose everything because of it? The thought of living a life consumed by fear is terrifying, but it's one that I can't seem to shake.

Does anyone else push away friends sometimes? : I've recently been going through some nonsense and I just found myself wanting to be around my friends less and less. I've pretty much stopped talking to almost everyone and avoid them whenever I can, but tbh I don't really even know why. I just suddenly felt like I wasn't welcome anymore, but nothing changed at all and I'm not angry or upset with them. Does anybody else do this?

Model
Here are 10 comments about the struggles of changing behavior related to depression:
I used to be so outgoing, but now I just want to hide away. I cancel plans, avoid social situations, and spend most of my time alone. It's like I'm becoming a hermit, retreating from the world that once brought me so much joy.
My friends are starting to notice, and it's making me feel even worse. I hate that I'm pushing them away, but I can't seem to help it. I feel like a burden to them, a constant reminder of my own struggles.
I'm not sure what's happening to me. It's like a switch flipped, and suddenly I don't want to do anything. I've lost all motivation, all interest in the things that used to bring me joy. I just want to stay in bed and disappear.
I feel like a stranger in my own body. My behavior is so different, so unlike my usual self. I'm constantly surprised by my own actions, my own words. It's like I'm watching myself from the outside, a stranger who doesn't recognize me.
I'm afraid of what this change in behavior means. Is this just a temporary phase, or is it the start of something much bigger? Is this who I am now, or is there a way back to my old self?
I'm trying to fight it, to resist the urge to withdraw, but it's so hard. It's like I'm battling a force stronger than myself, a force that's pulling me deeper and deeper into isolation.
I'm afraid of what this is doing to my relationships. I'm pushing away the people who care about me, the people who are trying to help. I hate that I'm hurting them, but I can't seem to stop.
I feel like I'm losing control. My behavior is unpredictable, even to myself. I'm making choices that I would never normally make, doing things that I would never normally do. It's like I'm possessed by something dark and sinister.
I'm starting to feel hopeless. If I can't control this change in behavior, what kind of life can I expect to have? Will I ever be able to connect with people again, to enjoy the things that once brought me happiness?
I'm afraid to hope for a better future. It feels like I'm setting myself up for disappointment. Maybe this is who I am now, maybe this is my fate. And that's a terrifying thought.

Examples:
Anyone else feels like a burden to their friends? ### I feel like my only friend is tired of me. Honestly? I don't blame her. Dealing with a miserable fuck like me must be pretty tiring. Whenever I bring up the fact that I don't feel good or try to share something personal it almost feels as if she wants to tell me to fuck off lol I feel bad saying all this, she means a lot to me and I'm sure she means well but.. damn I feel really lonely and alone with my problems. Maybe I'm just whiny and selfish but sometimes I want more than "Don't think about it, others have it worse". Sometimes I feel like I'm the problem and just pretend that everything is okay so she won't get uncomfortable around me. Is it selfish to feel this way? I feel really alone.
I just want this to be over already : I don't want to die or anything but wathever this is, i want it to stop. This feeling that lingers every fucking night when I'm alone with my thoughts, it's like my brain hated itself. I can't stop overthinking shit that doesn't matter anymore and this brings up insomnia wich results in me feeling absolutely misarable in the next day. I can't even put into words wtf is wrong with me, i just want to feel normal. I want to feel happy when i think about my career but even tho i love my field, all i feel is stress and doom. I want to be anxious about meeting someone and falling in love and having a family that is the complete opposite of mine but honestly, who would want a mess like me? God, i just want to feel like i belong somewhere and not that i was the weird kid invited out of pity.

I replay every conversation in my head, dissecting every word, every inflection, looking for any sign that I messed up. I'm constantly analyzing my behavior, searching for flaws, for reasons why people don't like me. It's exhausting, and it's making me feel worse.
I feel like a burden to everyone around me. I know they care, but I can't help but feel like I'm dragging them down with my negativity, my lack of motivation, my inability to contribute. I'm a drain on their energy, their time, their love.
I'm so afraid of making mistakes. Even the smallest slip-up sends me spiraling into a vortex of self-doubt and guilt. I'm constantly berating myself, replaying every misstep in my mind. It's a never-ending cycle of self-criticism and despair.
It's like I'm living in a constant state of self-loathing. I can't seem to escape the negative thoughts that plague me. I'm a failure, I'm ugly, I'm worthless. These words echo in my mind constantly, a relentless chorus of negativity.
I feel like I'm constantly letting people down. My partner, my friends, my family – I feel like I'm disappointing them all. I'm not good enough, I'm not doing enough, I'm not enough.
I'm so tired of overthinking everything. It's like I can't turn off my brain. Every conversation, every interaction, every decision is analyzed and dissected, leaving me feeling drained and exhausted.
I'm afraid to let myself be happy. It feels like a betrayal, like I'm disrespecting the pain I feel inside. I'm so used to feeling guilty and unworthy that even a flicker of joy feels out of place.
I'm trying to be positive, to focus on the good things in my life, but it's so hard. The negativity just keeps creeping back in, like a weed that I can't seem to eradicate. I'm constantly battling against my own self-destructive thoughts.
I'm afraid to trust anyone with my feelings. I'm afraid of being judged, of being rejected. It's easier to keep everything bottled up inside, to suffer in silence. But the guilt and self-blame just keep building and building.
I'm starting to feel hopeless. I don't know how to stop overthinking, how to overcome this guilt and self-blame. It feels like a permanent part of me, a defining characteristic of my depression.
I hate that I'm pushing away the people who care about me. I know I'm not being a good friend, a good partner, a good person. But I can't seem to help it. This guilt and self-blame are consuming me, and they're turning me into someone I don't even recognize.
I'm so tired of feeling like a failure. I've tried so hard, but nothing seems to work. I'm always making mistakes, always letting people down. It feels like I'm destined to be a disappointment, to never measure up.
I'm afraid of what this guilt and self-blame will do to me. It feels like it's taking over, consuming me. I'm afraid it will destroy my relationships, my career, my life.
It's like I'm living in a constant state of fear. I'm afraid of what others think of me, afraid of disappointing them, afraid of failing. This fear is paralyzing, making it impossible to move forward, to make choices, to take risks.
I'm trying to be kinder to myself, but it's so hard. The negative thoughts just keep coming back, like a bad habit I can't seem to break. I'm so used to beating myself up that it feels like I'm betraying myself when I try to be kind.
I'm afraid that I'll never be able to forgive myself. I've made so many mistakes, hurt so many people. I feel like I'm carrying the weight of the world on my shoulders, and I don't know how to let go.
I'm starting to lose hope that things will ever get better. The guilt and self-blame feel so pervasive, so all-encompassing, that it's hard to imagine a life without them. It's like I'm trapped in a never-ending cycle of self-punishment.
I'm so tired of feeling this way. This guilt and self-blame are draining me, taking away my joy, my energy, my motivation. I just want to feel good about myself, to feel like I'm worthy of love and happiness. But I don't know if that's even possible.
I'm afraid of the future. What if this guilt and self-blame just get worse? What if I lose everything because of it? The thought of living a life consumed by negativity is terrifying, but it's one that I can't seem to shake.
I just want to feel normal again, to feel like I'm okay. But the guilt and self-blame just keep coming back, like a bad dream I can't seem to wake up from. It's a never-ending cycle of self-destruction.

I feel like I have brain damage after months of severe mental breaks and depression ### I can't think straight, I feel unable to talk to people effectively, I feel confused or unsure of what's around me, I barely feel anything, I feel like I have little to no personality, I can barely remember things I've done or like to do in life These aren't things I've ever struggled with at all in my life and I don't understand what's happening or if it's ever going to change
feeling half unconscious ### I am feeling as if i am of this world. when i try to read my brain won't process the words. it takes a lot of effort to type this because my brain wont work as normal. this morning I woke up this way. i thought that i was tired. but my brain is still acting wonky as fuck. is this a mental issue or am i just a little sick? I know it maybe is a small problem but working this way is way more exhausting then normal.

Here are 10 comments about the struggles of cognitive dysfunction related to depression:
It's like my brain is stuck in slow motion. I can't focus, I can't concentrate, I can't even remember what I was going to say. Simple tasks that used to be effortless now require a Herculean effort. It's exhausting, and it's making me feel like I'm losing my mind.
I used to love to read, but now I can barely make it through a paragraph. Words blur together, and my thoughts drift away. It's like my brain is shutting down, refusing to process information.
Conversations are a struggle. I can't seem to follow the thread, and I often feel like I'm missing the point. I feel like a complete idiot, and I'm afraid people will think I'm stupid.
I'm constantly forgetting things. Appointments, conversations, important details – it's all a blur. It's like my memory is failing me, and I can't seem to trust my own mind anymore.
I feel like I'm living in a fog. Everything seems hazy and unclear. I'm constantly questioning myself, wondering if I'm making sense, if I'm even real. It's like I'm losing touch with reality.
I'm afraid that this cognitive dysfunction is permanent. What if I never recover, what if this is my new normal? The thought of living the rest of my life with a brain that doesn't work properly is terrifying.
I'm so frustrated with myself. I know I'm capable of so much more, but my brain just isn't cooperating. It's like I'm trapped in my own body, unable to access the mind that I used to know.
It's like I'm living in a constant state of brain fog. I can't think clearly, I can't make decisions, I can't even enjoy the things I used to love. It's a debilitating feeling, and it's making me feel hopeless.
I'm afraid that this cognitive dysfunction is a sign that something is wrong with me, that I'm damaged. It's like I'm broken, and I don't know how to fix myself.
I'm afraid to ask for help. I don't want to be seen as weak, as incompetent. It's easier to just pretend that everything is okay, to try to push through the fog. But it's exhausting, and it's taking a toll on my life.

I’m so down and I don’t know why : I just want to cry and sleep all the time. I have headaches, extreme hatred towards my body/weight. I’m so down and because I don’t understand why there’s nothing I can do. I’m at work in the morning but I honestly don’t know how I’m going to get out of bed

Here are 10 comments about the struggles of unexplained physical pain related to depression:
My body feels like one big ache. It's not a specific pain, just a general sense of discomfort and tightness. It's like my muscles are always tense, my joints are always sore, and I can't seem to shake this feeling of being unwell.
I'm constantly exhausted, but I also have this restless energy. I can't seem to relax, and my body is always tense. I just want to feel comfortable, but my own body feels like a stranger to me.
It's like my body is trying to tell me something, but I don't understand the language. The pain is so persistent, so pervasive, but there's no clear cause. It's a constant reminder that something is wrong, but I don't know what to do about it.
The pain is making it hard to function. I'm constantly distracted, constantly uncomfortable. Even simple tasks feel like a Herculean effort, and I just want to lie down and escape.
I'm afraid that this pain is a sign of something worse, something serious. I'm worried that it's a symptom of a bigger problem, a problem that I can't ignore. It's a terrifying thought, and it's making me feel even more anxious.
I'm so tired of feeling like a broken machine. My body is constantly betraying me, sending me these confusing signals of pain and discomfort. I just want to feel normal again, to feel like I'm in control of my own body.
It's like my body is rejecting me. The pain feels like a constant reminder that something is wrong, that I'm not okay. It's a physical manifestation of my depression, a reminder that I'm broken.
I'm afraid to talk to my doctor about it. I don't want to be seen as a hypochondriac, as someone who's making things up. It's easier to just suffer in silence, to pretend that everything is okay.
I'm starting to feel hopeless. What if this pain never goes away? What if it's just a permanent part of my depression? The thought of living a life in constant discomfort is terrifying.
I'm afraid to hope for anything better. It feels like I'm setting myself up for disappointment. Maybe this is my new normal, maybe this is all I'll ever know. And that's a terrifying thought.

WEIGHT CHANGE AND APPETITE

Generate 10 comments that describe the struggles of a person experiencing depression. The comments should reflect the negative aspects and challenges of living with depression. The comments must only include the theme of weight change and change in appetite. Use the following examples as a guide in terms of length and theme.
Examples:
Besides going to the doctor how do you know if your depressed ? How do you know if your normal is someone else’s normal ? Does alcohol make anyone unusually happy ? : I’m starting to wonder if I’m depressed , or maybe I’m just lazy. I have pretty low self esteem there are some days that are better but it’s never great. I rather stay in bed most days and I’ve gained a ton of weight. My eating habits are garbage I stick to eating very minimal eating but always choose foods that are shitty. I feel like a terrible person most times. I fantasize about suicide whenever I have a small problem. I also crave validation. Is this normal ? I’m not sure. I wonder if everyone feels this way. Are you supposed to feel happy everyday ? What am I supposed to feel normally ? I’m so much happier when I drink and it helps me fall asleep but I don’t want to become dependent. Anytime I feel happy there is always an ultimatum like I feel like it won’t last or it isn’t supposed to be that way.
Why does food always work for my depression : I’ve tried medication, therapy, and I even went to a crisis center to get help with my depression. But the medication didn’t work, I felt like my therapist wasn’t helping that much, and I felt more depressed at the crisis center cuz there were people there who were worse off than me. Even before I got professional help, I would always rely on food to make me happy and it always did. Every time I eat, I feel so much better. Even though, people call me a pig and tell me to lose weight, I don’t give a f. As long as I don’t get obese, I just want to rely on food. It’s the only thing that makes me happy. Having friendships with people doesn’t make me happy as they just betray me and I regret putting all that effort in just to pretend that I’m okay. I think that I’ll be fine off alone.

Here are 10 comments about the struggles of weight change and appetite changes related to depression:
I can't seem to stop eating. It's like I'm trying to fill a void, to numb the pain with food. I know it's not healthy, but I can't seem to control it. I'm gaining weight, and it's making me feel even worse. It's like I'm losing control of my own body.
I used to love to cook, but now the thought of food makes me feel sick. I've lost my appetite, and I can barely force myself to eat. I'm losing weight, and I can feel my body weakening. It's like my depression is slowly consuming me from the inside out.
It's like my body is rebelling against me. I can't seem to control my weight, my appetite, my cravings. I feel like I'm trapped in a cycle of overeating and self-loathing. It's a constant reminder that something is wrong, that I'm not okay.
I'm afraid of what this weight gain is doing to my body. I'm worried about my health, my self-esteem, my future. It's like I'm losing myself, one pound at a time.
I feel like I'm failing at taking care of myself. I know I should be eating healthy, but I just can't seem to muster the energy or the motivation. It feels like I'm letting myself down, letting everyone down.
I'm starting to feel hopeless. What if this weight gain never goes away? What if I just keep getting bigger and bigger, and there's nothing I can do about it? The thought of living a life where I'm constantly struggling with my weight is terrifying.
I feel like I'm trapped in a cycle of self-destruction. I overeat, I feel guilty, I restrict my diet, I feel deprived, I binge eat again. It's a never-ending cycle of shame and regret.
I'm afraid to talk to my doctor about it. I don't want to be judged, to be seen as weak or out of control. It's easier to just suffer in silence, to pretend that everything is okay.
I'm afraid that this weight change is a sign that something is wrong with me, that I'm broken. It's like my body is rebelling against me, and I don't know how to fix it.
I'm afraid to hope for a better future. What if this weight gain never goes away? What if I just keep getting bigger and bigger, and there's nothing I can do about it? The thought of living a life where I'm constantly struggling with my weight is terrifying.

Examples:
Is it weird that I feel like I’m faking depression symptoms? ### I answered my psychiatrist’s questions and after we finished she diagnosed me with anxiety and major depressive disorder(MDD), but I feel like I’m just faking it sometimes. Is it common for people to feel this way about themselves?
Tired all the time ### I am 32 and live with my parents and I am tired all the time my psychologist diagnosed me with severe depression and anxiety but everyone in my family thinks I am faking it and that I am just LAZY. I have lost jobs, friends and relationships over this. All I feel is the disappointment from everyone around me that I am not good enough or that I need to “suck it up” and move on. These past months the thoughts have been getting more and more intense so all I can think to do is sleep longer and long to push them away but even that is starting to fail me. I am just a lost soul in a sea we’re I am not allowed to breathe.

Here are 20 comments about the struggles of living with a Major Depressive Disorder diagnosis:
It's hard to believe that I actually have MDD. It feels so real, so consuming, but a part of me still thinks it's just a phase, that I'm just being dramatic. It's like I'm trying to convince myself that it's not as bad as it really is.
I'm so tired of explaining myself. People don't understand what it's like to live with MDD, and they often dismiss my symptoms as laziness or weakness. It's exhausting to constantly fight for validation, to try to prove that I'm not just making it up.
I feel like a broken record. I've been diagnosed with MDD before, and I've tried everything to get better, but nothing seems to work. It's like I'm stuck in a cycle of despair, constantly repeating the same painful experience.
It's hard to accept that this is my new normal. I used to be so full of life, so energetic, so happy. Now, it's like a part of me has died, and I'm just trying to survive.
I'm afraid of what the future holds. If MDD is a lifelong condition, what kind of life can I expect to have? Will I ever be able to feel happy again, to achieve my dreams, to live a fulfilling life?
I feel like I'm letting everyone down. My family, my friends, my partner – they all want me to be happy, but I just can't seem to get out of this darkness. It's like I'm dragging them down with me, and I hate that I'm causing them pain.
I'm so tired of fighting. It feels like I'm constantly battling against this overwhelming sense of despair. I'm starting to lose hope that I'll ever win, that I'll ever feel like myself again.
It's hard to trust that medication will help. I've tried so many different antidepressants, but nothing seems to work. I'm afraid that I'll just keep cycling through medications, always hoping for a miracle that never comes.
I'm afraid of becoming dependent on medication. What if I can't function without it? What if it just masks the real problem, and I'm never really able to get better?
I feel like I'm a burden on my loved ones. They're constantly trying to help, but it feels like I'm just dragging them down with me. I hate that I'm causing them pain, but I can't seem to stop.
I'm afraid to open up to people about my MDD. I'm worried about being judged, about being seen as weak or broken. It's easier to just pretend that I'm okay, to keep my feelings bottled up inside.
I feel like I'm failing at being a good friend, a good partner, a good person. I'm not able to be the person I want to be, the person that my loved ones deserve. It's a constant source of guilt and shame.
It's hard to be patient with myself. I want to feel better, I want to get back to my old self, but it's taking time. I'm constantly reminding myself that recovery is a process, but it's hard to stay positive when I feel so lost and alone.
I feel like I'm losing myself to this MDD. It's changing who I am, the way I think, the way I feel, the way I act. I'm afraid that I'll never be able to get myself back.
I'm afraid that I'll never be able to find love or happiness. What kind of person would want to be with someone who's constantly struggling with MDD? It feels like I'm destined to be alone, to live a life of sadness and despair.
I'm afraid that MDD will define my life. I'm afraid that it will become my identity, my defining characteristic. I don't want to be known as the person with MDD, but I'm afraid that's all I'll ever be.
I'm trying to be strong, to be positive, to find hope, but it's so hard. The MDD is constantly whispering in my ear, telling me that I'm worthless, that I'll never get better. It's a constant battle, and I'm starting to feel like I'm losing.
I'm so tired of feeling like this. I just want to feel happy again, to feel like myself again. But it feels like a distant dream, a hope that I can't even grasp.
I'm afraid that I'll never be able to escape this darkness. It feels like I'm trapped, like there's no way out. It's a terrifying thought, but it's also the one that feels most real.
I'm afraid to hope for anything better. It feels like I'm setting myself up for disappointment. Maybe this is my new normal, maybe this is all I'll ever know. And that's a terrifying thought.

Generate 10 comments that describe the struggles of a person experiencing depression. The comments should reflect the negative aspects and challenges of living with depression.

Example:
Hypersexuality as a coping mechanism : Hi. I hope this isn't too forward a question or inappropriate.
Have any you had problems with hypersexuality as a coping mechanism for your depression? I'll be honest and admit I masturbate way way way too much, watch way too much porn etc for those short bursts of dopamine it triggers in my brain.
I can't tell if it's perhaps a coping mechanism or not but I at times have next to no sexual desire or fantasies during but just do it out of habit, probably because of the dopamine it triggers (which in return leaves me even more depressed, shameful and exhausted afterwards).
Does anyone else have a problem like this or can relate? I mean; By all measures hypersexuality and depression doesn't sound like it mixes well but I have this idea it might be the case for me.

Model
Here are 10 comments about the struggles of hypersexuality related to depression:
It's like a vicious cycle. I use sex as a way to escape my depression, but it only makes me feel worse in the long run. The shame and guilt afterwards are overwhelming, and I feel even more empty and hopeless.
I can't seem to control it. The urge is so intense, it's like a force outside of me. I know it's not healthy, but I can't seem to stop. It feels like I'm trapped in a cage of my own making.
I'm afraid to talk to anyone about it. I'm ashamed of my behavior, and I don't want to be judged. It's like a dirty secret that I'm carrying around, and it weighs on me constantly.
I feel like I'm losing myself. I used to be able to find pleasure in other things, but now it's all about sex. It's like my whole life is revolving around this one thing, and it's not healthy.
I'm starting to feel hopeless. I don't know how to break free from this cycle of hypersexuality and depression. It feels like I'm trapped, and I don't know how to get out.
It's not even pleasurable anymore. It's just a way to numb the pain, to escape the emptiness for a few fleeting moments. But the relief is short-lived, and the guilt and shame just keep coming back.
I'm afraid of becoming addicted. It's like I'm chasing a high that I can never quite reach. I know it's unhealthy, but I can't seem to stop. It's a constant battle with myself.
I'm worried that my hypersexuality is pushing away the people I care about. They don't understand why I'm so obsessed with sex, and I feel like I'm losing them.
It's like I'm living a double life. I'm trying to be a normal person, but my secret addiction is slowly taking over. I'm afraid that it will eventually consume me.
I'm afraid to seek help. I don't want to be labeled, to be judged, to be seen as a freak. But I know that I can't keep this secret forever. I need to find a way to break free from this cycle of self-destruction.

The comments must only include the theme of loss of interest in sex and physical touch. Use the following examples as a guide in terms of length and theme.
Examples:
Considering Lamictal / lamotrigine, but drugs have never done anything for me. ### I have gone through so many meds for depression and I've never had one where I could definitively see a positive impact. My prescriber suggested Lamictal and I don't feel like it's worth trying because nothing else has ever helped my mood. I'm also concerned about the side effects. Prescriber downplays them but I know everyone is different. Esp paranoid about sexual side effects because of my experience with SSRIs (I know Lamictal isn't an SSRI tho). Has anyone here had success with Lamictal after nothing else did any good? Trying to make a decision here and I keep holding out hope that something will change but after 30+ years I just want to give up.
For those of you whose partner has been taking antidepressants: - How long have they been on meds for? - Did antidepressants help your partner? - Did antidepressants help your relationship? What were the effects? (I know this is a selfish question; but I have to ask) What improved, what got worse? Sex, mood, feelings of isolation, you name it.

Model
Here are 10 comments about the struggles of losing interest in sex and physical touch related to depression:
It's like the spark just went out. I used to crave my partner's touch, but now I just feel numb. I hate that I'm not able to be the person they deserve, the person they fell in love with. It feels like a betrayal, even though it's not intentional.
I'm afraid to initiate intimacy, because I don't want to be rejected. The thought of being turned down just makes me feel worse, like I'm even more worthless. It's a vicious cycle of fear and avoidance.
I miss the feeling of connection. I miss the way my partner used to look at me, the way they'd touch me with such tenderness. Now, it feels like we're living in separate worlds, two ships passing in the night.
I'm afraid this loss of desire is a sign that something is wrong with me, that I'm not good enough. It feels like I'm failing at being a partner, failing at being a person. It's a heavy burden to carry.
I'm trying to talk to my doctor about it, but I'm scared to admit how bad it's gotten. I feel like I'm failing, like I'm not doing enough to fix this. It's a vicious cycle of shame and avoidance.
The thought of sex makes me feel anxious and overwhelmed. It's like a reminder of everything that's wrong with me, everything I'm not able to do or enjoy. It just adds to the feeling of despair.
I'm afraid of hurting my partner. I know they love me and want to be close to me, but I can't seem to reciprocate. It feels like I'm betraying them, even though it's not intentional.
I'm losing hope that I'll ever feel like myself again. The loss of interest in sex and physical touch feels like a permanent part of my depression. It's like I'm trapped in a body that doesn't belong to me.
It's not just about sex, it's about the feeling of connection. I used to crave physical closeness, but now even a hug feels like a burden. I'm afraid I'm losing the ability to connect with anyone on a physical level.
I feel like I'm failing at being a partner. I know that intimacy is an important part of a relationship, but I just can't seem to deliver. It's like I'm broken, and I don't know how to fix it.

I miss the person she is when she isn't depressed. I miss being able to make her laugh. I miss the positive regard of my own self that comes from vibing so much with her and us having fun together and her liking me. She is so easily irritated with me these days, in ways I don't feel I deserve. I miss meeting her in that connected place that we go to during sex. I miss our sex. I feel so anxious because of how emotionally unresponsive she is. I feel hurt and angry and want to also shut down/pull away in protest, but realize that hurting her won't bring her back and then I just feel helpless.
How has your partners depression affected your sex life? How do you deal with it? How do you talk about it? How do you feel about it? As a wife I’m struggling a lot but I don’t want to be insensitive.
Can’t bring myself out of isolation ### I’ve completely lost my confidence. I used to be fun at parties. I used to meet my friends all the time. I used to be flirty and have a lot of random sex. Now i’m just at home isolating everyday and just rotting year after year. I can’t bring myself out of it.

It feels like I've turned into a different person. I used to crave physical intimacy, but now even the thought of it makes me feel empty and detached. It's like my body is telling me it's not capable of enjoying something I used to love.
My partner is trying so hard to be understanding, but it just feels like a constant reminder of what I'm missing. It's heartbreaking to see the hurt in their eyes, knowing I can't reciprocate the way they desire.
It feels like a betrayal of my own self and my partner. I know that intimacy is important, and I want to be able to experience it, but it's just so difficult to feel anything.
I hate how this affects our connection. I long to be the kind of partner who craves intimacy and feels fulfilled, but instead I feel like I'm pushing them further away. It's agonizing.
I'm worried it's making my partner feel undesirable or rejected. The thought of them thinking they are unloved because of my inability to connect physically adds to my sense of worthlessness.
It feels like I'm living a lie, pretending that things are okay, pretending that I want these physical experiences when I don't. The guilt and the shame just compound the feeling of being stuck.
It makes me feel so distant, so separate from myself. It's like I'm watching a movie about someone else who has desire and passion, and I'm the spectator, unable to feel the warmth of those emotions.
I worry that this will become a permanent fixture of my life. It's a deeply lonely experience to be emotionally distant and uninterested in intimacy, and it's hard to see a path forward.
I know this affects my relationship more than just me, and that’s a huge weight on my shoulders. I feel responsible for hurting my partner, and it makes it even harder to take steps to get better.
Sometimes, I wonder if my partner would even be with me if they knew how unattracted I feel to them right now. The fear of losing them because of something I can’t control is excruciating. It's like my depression is driving a wedge between us.

Examples:
-How can I deal with loneliness? ### I feel so lonely all the time. I have little to no friends and my coworkers don't like me. I don't have a girlfriend. In fact in 27 years of life I only had a short long-distance relationship (when I was 26). Now I'm single and I'm sad cause I'm stuck in a small town where I can't seem to meet people my age ( none who are single anyway). I have very strong romantic desires/needs (I want hugs and kisses, mostly) and it drives me crazy. Im so jealous of all the couples I see lol even my friends (or maybe especially my friends, since I know how wild their sex life is)
-"I feel a bit trapped : I dont know if im depressed, probably not but oh boy sometimes I wonder. Its not like I can't get out of bed, or am not functional. But for the past few years ive been so alone. I want to angrily vomit, scream, cry, I don't know, i always feel so stupif, i cant explain it. Especially when somone does somthing for me, I just feel stupid. There is ample evidence of it in my family.
What brought me here was I just realized that Im all alone in the world with nobody to talk to about my feelings. And now I just want somome to weep shamelessly on. I have close friends, but im scared. I'm terrified, all my life I never let myself be vulnrable like that. And the few times I did, it didn't go well. Mayne I was doing it wrong and its my fault idk. I'm so jelous of people who can just talk about thejr emotional turmoil to their friends. I certainly don't think other people are weak when they do it, but when I do it, I'm weak. I don't want anyone to ""save me"", I just wanna let loose for once."

It's like I'm living in a silent movie. Everyone else is laughing, talking, and connecting, but I'm just watching from the sidelines, unable to participate. I feel like a ghost, invisible and unheard.
I'm surrounded by people, but I feel so alone. I crave connection, but it feels impossible to reach out. I'm afraid of being rejected, of being seen as a burden. So I just retreat further into myself.
I long for a hug, a simple act of affection, but it feels so far away. I'm surrounded by people who love me, but I can't seem to let them in. I'm afraid of being vulnerable, of showing my true self.
The silence is deafening. I miss the sound of laughter, the feeling of being part of a conversation. I miss having someone to share my thoughts and feelings with, someone who understands.
I'm afraid of becoming a hermit. I don't want to spend the rest of my life alone, but I don't know how to break out of this cycle of loneliness and isolation. It feels like I'm sinking deeper and deeper into despair.
I feel like a burden to everyone around me. I know they care, but I can't help but feel like I'm dragging them down with me. It's easier to just push them away, to keep my distance.
I envy people who have close friends and family. It seems so simple for them, but for me, it's an impossible dream. I'm constantly surrounded by reminders of my own loneliness, and it's heartbreaking.
I'm afraid I'll never find someone who can truly understand me, someone who can accept me for who I am. I'm afraid of being alone for the rest of my life, of never feeling truly connected to another person.
I'm so tired of feeling like a shadow. I want to be seen, to be heard, to be loved. But I don't know how to make that happen. It feels like I'm trapped in a cycle of loneliness and despair.
I'm losing hope that things will ever change. It's like I'm living in a perpetual twilight zone, trapped in a world of isolation and heartache. I'm starting to feel like this is my fate, my destiny. It's a terrifying thought.

It's like a heavy weight on my chest, a constant ache in my soul. I can't shake this feeling of sadness, no matter how hard I try. It's like a dark cloud that follows me everywhere.
I used to find joy in simple things, but now everything feels muted. Colors seem less vibrant, laughter sounds hollow, and even the things I used to love just leave me feeling empty.
I feel like I'm drowning in a sea of sorrow. Every wave of sadness pulls me further down, and I can't seem to find a way back to the surface. It's like I'm losing the ability to feel anything but this crushing despair.
I'm so tired of crying. My tears have run dry, but the sadness remains. It's a constant ache in my heart, a gnawing emptiness that I can't seem to fill.
I'm afraid to let myself feel happy. It feels like a betrayal, like I'm disrespecting the sadness that consumes me. I'm so used to feeling down that even a flicker of joy feels out of place.
It's like I'm living in a perpetual twilight zone. The world feels gray and lifeless, and even the smallest joys feel fleeting and insignificant. I can't seem to find any real sense of purpose or meaning.
I'm starting to lose hope that I'll ever feel happy again. The sadness feels so pervasive, so all-encompassing, that it's hard to imagine a life without it. It's like I'm living in a constant state of mourning.
I feel like I'm burdening everyone around me. My sadness feels like a dark cloud that follows me everywhere, and I'm afraid I'm casting a shadow on everyone who comes into my life.
I'm so tired of being tired. This sadness is draining me, stealing my energy and my motivation. I just want to feel something, anything, other than this crushing despair.
I'm afraid to let myself hope for a better future. It feels like I'm setting myself up for disappointment. The sadness feels so real, so constant, that I'm starting to believe it's all I'll ever know. It's a terrifying thought.

"is it normal that someone haven't experienced happiness for a long time? ### i rarley feel happy and content i dont feel sad most of the time, sometimes I experience sadness and most of the time i feel empty neither happy neither sad. so my question is it normal to not feeling happiness for a very very long time or it means i suffer from something."

It's like a shadow that follows me everywhere. Even when things are good, the sadness is there, lurking beneath the surface. It's like a constant weight that I carry, pulling me down.
I used to cry easily, but now it feels like my tears have dried up. I'm just empty inside, a hollow shell of the person I used to be. It's frightening to feel this way.
I'm starting to believe that I'll never be truly happy again. The sadness feels like an inevitable part of my existence, a permanent fixture in my world. I feel so lost, so alone.
I hate that it feels like I'm burdening people around me. My sadness seems to cast a shadow on everyone else's joy, and it breaks my heart. It feels like everyone is walking on eggshells.
It’s exhausting trying to pretend I’m not sad. I try to force a smile, make lighthearted jokes, but it’s so difficult. It feels like I’m trapped inside a dark cloud I can’t escape.
Sometimes it’s like my world turns grey, even colors seem dull. Everything feels hopeless. It’s hard to find the energy to care about anything, even things that used to bring me happiness.
Even small things can set me off. Hearing someone laugh can bring a wave of sadness. Watching people having fun makes me feel even more empty. It's like a constant reminder that I'm different.
I try to hide it, to act like I'm okay, but I'm not. I feel so vulnerable when I let someone see how I really feel. The thought of exposing this part of me feels terrifying.
My friends and family try to be supportive, but I don't know how to let them in. It's so hard to explain this persistent sadness. It feels so big, so consuming, that it's impossible to put into words.
I feel so misunderstood. I'm not the "typical" sad person. It's not a single event or loss causing this. It's just this persistent, draining, always-present feeling. I just want it to go away, to feel happy again, but it seems so far away.

Example:
-> Lather, rinse, and repeat : I've really been a depressive since the age of 12 (now 25). In my late teens, my anxiety became too much to handle and I reluctantly jumped on the psych med merry-go-round. I used SSRIs for a couple years and experienced some benefit, though never achieved full remission. Due to the emotional blunting, sexual dysfunction, among other side effects, I decided to quit.
~ 4 years later, I'm still fucked up from the drugs. I suffer from anhedonia, decreased libido, head pressure, among other symptoms. The original anxiety is still present -- perhaps more so -- with an additional later of drug-induced depression added to the mix.
I've been trying to live as ""normally"" as possible with thes lasting side-effects, but I'm effectively faking my way through life. I'm in graduate school to kill some time, but I enjoy very little. Everything feels full and meaningless.
Every time I wake up, the first thought is ""not again.""
How many times must I repeat this draining, joyless day?
They say you have to play the hand you're dealt in life. When is it time to fold?

Here are 10 comments about the struggles of emptiness related to depression:
It's like I'm living in a black and white world. Colors have lost their vibrancy, and even the things I used to love no longer bring me joy. Everything feels empty, hollow, and meaningless.
I feel like a ghost in my own life. I'm going through the motions, but I'm not truly present. I'm just a shell, a vacant vessel with no real sense of self or purpose.
I'm surrounded by people who love me, but I can't seem to connect with them. It's like I'm trapped in a glass box, watching them live their lives while I'm frozen in a state of emotional numbness.
I'm afraid to let myself hope for anything. The thought of feeling joy again seems like a betrayal, a mockery of the emptiness I feel inside. It's easier to just accept that this is my fate, my reality.
I'm so tired of trying to fill the void. I've tried everything – hobbies, relationships, travel – but nothing seems to work. The emptiness is always there, lurking beneath the surface, ready to swallow me whole.
The thought of spending the rest of my life like this is terrifying. I don't want to just exist, I want to truly live. But I'm starting to lose hope that it's even possible.
I feel like I'm slowly fading away, like I'm losing myself to the emptiness. I don't recognize the person I've become, and I'm afraid that I'll never get myself back.
It's like my heart is made of stone. I can't feel anything, not love, not joy, not even sadness. Just this overwhelming sense of emptiness that consumes me entirely.
I'm afraid to reach out for help. I don't want to burden anyone with my emptiness, my despair. It feels like I'm a broken record, repeating the same sad story over and over again.
I'm starting to believe that this is all I'll ever know. The emptiness is becoming my reality, my truth. It's a terrifying thought, but it's also the one that feels most real.

"How do you get through work with depression amd anxiety? : I am dealing with a very bad spell of depression and anxiety the past couple weeks. To the point where I am waking up in a panic, covered in sweat. I managed to pick up extra hours at work right before the depression hit. Now it's time to go work those extra hours but I am too messed up to do anything. What do I do? I would feel horrible calling out of work because they gave those extra hours to me (they could have gave them to 3 other people but i happened to have been present when my manager was giving out hours) but I am not in a good state to do anything. It has been the worst week I have had in a while. I'm afraid of having a mental breakdown at work. I feel one coming."
What is happening to me ? I feel like I’m getting worse : I’m on sertraline and cymbalta.
The last few days I’ve felt worse than ever. I am crying over EVERYTHING , I’m hating my life, everything is giving me anxiety attacks and I had the worst panic attack of my entire life yesterday.
I’m back in therapy which is great since my last therapist unexpectedly died , I like my new one and our first session was nearly 2 hours .. I see her again in 2 weeks.
But I don’t understand what’s going on with me . It’s like my meds have stopped working as of two days ago. Has this happened to anyone before ? I haven’t cried this much in 4 years. I’m so sad and angry and I don’t even know why.
I feel so alone.

Here are 10 comments about the struggles of anxiety related to depression:
It's like I'm constantly on edge, waiting for the other shoe to drop. Every noise, every text, every email sends my heart racing. I can't seem to relax, even for a moment. It's exhausting, and it's making me feel like I'm going crazy.
My mind is a constant whirlwind of worry. What if I said the wrong thing? What if I didn't do enough? What if something bad happens? The questions never stop, and the anxiety just keeps building and building.
I'm afraid to leave the house. Every social interaction feels like a potential minefield of anxiety. What if I say something stupid? What if people judge me? It's easier to just stay home and avoid the world altogether.
I feel like I'm losing control. My heart is pounding, my breathing is shallow, my thoughts are racing. It's like a physical manifestation of my fear, and I can't seem to calm down.
I'm afraid to tell anyone how I feel. I don't want to burden them with my anxieties, my fears. It's easier to just pretend that I'm okay, but the anxiety is eating me alive.
It's like I'm living in a constant state of fight-or-flight. My body is always on high alert, ready to run at the slightest provocation. Even the simplest tasks feel overwhelming, and I just want to escape.
I'm so tired of feeling this way. The anxiety is draining me, taking away my joy, my energy, my motivation. I just want to feel calm, to feel safe, to feel normal.
I'm afraid that this anxiety will never go away. It's becoming a part of me, a defining characteristic of my existence. I'm afraid that I'll never be able to live a normal life, a happy life.
I'm losing hope that anything will ever get better. The anxiety feels so pervasive, so all-encompassing, that it's hard to imagine a life without it. It's like I'm trapped in a never-ending cycle of fear and worry.
I'm afraid of the future. What if this anxiety just gets worse? What if I lose everything because of it? The thought of living a life consumed by fear is terrifying, but it's one that I can't seem to shake.

I can't truly live because of my mental health ### This depression and anxiety thing is a full-time job. I spend all day focusing on it, I have no off switch. I'm really stuck thinking about the grand scheme of things. How pointless everything is, then, when I'm able to get back into living I see how far behind It's gotten me. Everyone else is moving forward in life and I'm just stuck with no motivation to move. I'm too scared to do anything, my comfort zone is so small. I just wish I were like them. The social world around me won't feel bad for me, It'll just move on without me. I'm losing precious years of my life that I'll never get back. It's just adding to my stress which I already can barely handle. I'm such a wreck. I can't do anything! It feels like I'm trapped being a loser in the most important social time I have. I feel like I'll never catch up."

It's like a constant low hum of unease, always there in the background, even when things seem okay. It makes it impossible to truly relax. Every day feels like walking on eggshells.
My mind races with "what ifs." It's like a broken record of worry, spinning out of control. It makes focusing on anything else nearly impossible. I feel exhausted but wired.
Simple things trigger a wave of panic. A phone call, a text, even a loud noise can send me into a spiral. I hate how quickly it overtakes me, how easily my whole body feels threatened.
I know I should talk to someone, but it's terrifying. What if I'm a burden? What if they judge me? What if it doesn't help? I just end up staying stuck and struggling on my own.
I'm afraid to pursue anything I really want. The fear of failure, of rejection, of people seeing me fail is so overwhelming, it feels safer to just stay small and hidden.
My body reacts to every little stressor. I'm constantly on high alert, jittery, and uncomfortable. The physical symptoms make the anxiety feel so much worse.
I want to connect, but social situations feel impossible. I'm too scared to be myself, to speak up, to be vulnerable. The thought of making a mistake, of saying the wrong thing, is paralyzing.
This feeling of being overwhelmed is constantly chipping away at my motivation. I know I need to get better, but the anxiety feels so large, so insurmountable, that I just end up giving up.
It's like living a half-life, stuck in a perpetual state of apprehension. I can't enjoy anything fully because the anxiety always lurks in the back of my mind. I feel trapped and afraid of what’s next.
I’m losing my hope that it will ever go away. It's become a constant companion. The idea of feeling truly calm and safe feels like a distant dream.

It's like I'm living in a black hole. No matter how hard I try, I can't escape the pull of despair. Every attempt to find joy, to feel hope, is swallowed up by this overwhelming darkness.
I'm afraid to dream. What's the point? My dreams will never come true. I'm destined to fail, to be disappointed, to be trapped in this cycle of sadness and despair.
I feel like I'm drowning in a sea of hopelessness. Every wave of despair pulls me further down, and I can't seem to find a way to stay afloat. It's like I'm losing my grip on reality, on the very will to live.
I'm so tired of fighting. It feels like I'm swimming upstream, constantly battling against this relentless tide of despair. I'm starting to lose hope that I'll ever reach the shore.
I'm afraid to let myself feel anything other than sadness. The thought of happiness, of joy, feels like a betrayal, a cruel reminder of what I've lost. It's easier to just stay in this state of perpetual despair.
The thought of the future fills me with dread. What's the point of planning, of hoping, of dreaming? I'm destined to fail, to be trapped in this cycle of hopelessness. I can't see a way out.
I'm afraid of losing myself to this despair. It's starting to consume me, to define me. I'm afraid that I'll never be able to escape its grasp, to find my way back to the person I used to be.
I'm so tired of feeling like a burden. I'm draining the energy and the hope out of everyone around me. I hate that I'm causing them pain, but I can't seem to stop. It feels like I'm just a black hole, sucking in everything good in my life.
I'm starting to believe that this is all I'll ever know. Hopelessness is becoming my reality, my truth. It's a terrifying thought, but it's also the one that feels most real.
I'm afraid to hope for a better future. It feels like I'm setting myself up for disappointment. I'm destined to be a failure, a disappointment, a burden on the world. And I'm starting to accept it.

Here are 10 comments about the struggles of unexplained physical pain related to depression:
My body feels like one big ache. It's not a specific pain, just a general sense of discomfort and tightness. It's like my muscles are always tense, my joints are always sore, and I can't seem to shake this feeling of being unwell.
I'm constantly exhausted, but I also have this restless energy. I can't seem to relax, and my body is always tense. I just want to feel comfortable, but my own body feels like a stranger to me.
It's like my body is trying to tell me something, but I don't understand the language. The pain is so persistent, so pervasive, but there's no clear cause. It's a constant reminder that something is wrong, but I don't know what to do about it.
The pain is making it hard to function. I'm constantly distracted, constantly uncomfortable. Even simple tasks feel like a Herculean effort, and I just want to lie down and escape.
I'm afraid that this pain is a sign of something worse, something serious. I'm worried that it's a symptom of a bigger problem, a problem that I can't ignore. It's a terrifying thought, and it's making me feel even more anxious.
I'm so tired of feeling like a broken machine. My body is constantly betraying me, sending me these confusing signals of pain and discomfort. I just want to feel normal again, to feel like I'm in control of my own body.
It's like my body is rejecting me. The pain feels like a constant reminder that something is wrong, that I'm not okay. It's a physical manifestation of my depression, a reminder that I'm broken.
I'm afraid to talk to my doctor about it. I don't want to be seen as a hypochondriac, as someone who's making things up. It's easier to just suffer in silence, to pretend that everything is okay.
I'm starting to feel hopeless. What if this pain never goes away? What if it's just a permanent part of my depression? The thought of living a life in constant discomfort is terrifying.
I'm afraid to hope for anything better. It feels like I'm setting myself up for disappointment. Maybe this is my new normal, maybe this is all I'll ever know. And that's a terrifying thought.

WEIGHT CHANGE AND APPETITE RERUN

The comments must only include the theme of weight change and change in appetite. Use the following examples as a guide in terms of length and theme.
Examples:
Besides going to the doctor how do you know if your depressed ? How do you know if your normal is someone else’s normal ? Does alcohol make anyone unusually happy ? : I’m starting to wonder if I’m depressed , or maybe I’m just lazy. I have pretty low self esteem there are some days that are better but it’s never great. I rather stay in bed most days and I’ve gained a ton of weight. My eating habits are garbage I stick to eating very minimal eating but always choose foods that are shitty. I feel like a terrible person most times. I fantasize about suicide whenever I have a small problem. I also crave validation. Is this normal ? I’m not sure. I wonder if everyone feels this way. Are you supposed to feel happy everyday ? What am I supposed to feel normally ? I’m so much happier when I drink and it helps me fall asleep but I don’t want to become dependent. Anytime I feel happy there is always an ultimatum like I feel like it won’t last or it isn’t supposed to be that way.
Why does food always work for my depression : I’ve tried medication, therapy, and I even went to a crisis center to get help with my depression. But the medication didn’t work, I felt like my therapist wasn’t helping that much, and I felt more depressed at the crisis center cuz there were people there who were worse off than me. Even before I got professional help, I would always rely on food to make me happy and it always did. Every time I eat, I feel so much better. Even though, people call me a pig and tell me to lose weight, I don’t give a f. As long as I don’t get obese, I just want to rely on food. It’s the only thing that makes me happy. Having friendships with people doesn’t make me happy as they just betray me and I regret putting all that effort in just to pretend that I’m okay. I think that I’ll be fine off alone.

I can't seem to stop eating. It's like I'm trying to fill a void, to numb the pain with food. I know it's not healthy, but I can't seem to control it. I'm gaining weight, and it's making me feel even worse. It's like I'm losing control of my own body.
I used to love to cook, but now the thought of food makes me feel sick. I've lost my appetite, and I can barely force myself to eat. I'm losing weight, and I can feel my body weakening. It's like my depression is slowly consuming me from the inside out.
It's like my body is rebelling against me. I can't seem to control my weight, my appetite, my cravings. I feel like I'm trapped in a cycle of overeating and self-loathing. It's a constant reminder that something is wrong, that I'm not okay.
I'm afraid of what this weight gain is doing to my body. I'm worried about my health, my self-esteem, my future. It's like I'm losing myself, one pound at a time.
I feel like I'm failing at taking care of myself. I know I should be eating healthy, but I just can't seem to muster the energy or the motivation. It feels like I'm letting myself down, letting everyone down.
I'm starting to feel hopeless. What if this weight gain never goes away? What if I just keep getting bigger and bigger, and there's nothing I can do about it? The thought of living a life where I'm constantly struggling with my weight is terrifying.
I feel like I'm trapped in a cycle of self-destruction. I overeat, I feel guilty, I restrict my diet, I feel deprived, I binge eat again. It's a never-ending cycle of shame and regret.
I'm afraid to talk to my doctor about it. I don't want to be judged, to be seen as weak or out of control. It's easier to just suffer in silence, to pretend that everything is okay.
I'm afraid that this weight change is a sign that something is wrong with me, that I'm broken. It's like my body is rebelling against me, and I don't know how to fix it.
I'm afraid to hope for a better future. What if this weight gain never goes away? What if I just keep getting bigger and bigger, and there's nothing I can do about it? The thought of living a life where I'm constantly struggling with my weight is terrifying.

Here are 10 comments about the struggles of unexplained physical pain related to depression, focusing on headaches, muscle aches, and migraines:
It’s like my head is in a vice. I wake up with a headache most days, and it never seems to go away completely. It's just a dull ache, but it’s constant and draining. It’s hard to focus or even enjoy anything.
I'm so tired of being sore. Every muscle in my body feels stiff and aching. It feels like I've been in a car accident, but without the accident. Even sitting still is painful, and it's hard to motivate myself to do anything.
I never know when a migraine is coming. They hit suddenly and are so debilitating, I’m incapacitated for hours. I miss work, I can't do anything but lay in a dark room, wishing the pain would just stop. It makes my depression even worse.
It’s like my body is giving me a constant message of warning, but I don’t know how to translate it. It's just physical pain, but I’m terrified it's a sign of something serious, even though the doctors can’t find a cause.
It’s exhausting explaining to people why I’m hurting, especially when it’s hard to even pinpoint the reason myself. I feel dismissed a lot because it seems so “minor” – a headache, muscle soreness, but it makes my days a constant struggle.
Even simple things become impossible when my body is hurting. Making dinner, going for a walk, even reading, feel like too much. I end up isolating myself because my body doesn’t let me participate.
It’s so hard to focus on the “mental” side of my depression when my body is betraying me. The physical pain makes it even harder to access the therapy and mindfulness techniques that might help my mental health.
The constant ache, the pounding headaches, the agonizing migraines feel like a cruel trick. My depression has already taken so much away, and now it's like my body is trying to add more misery.
I just want to feel normal again. To have a day without pain. To be able to move without a dull ache. To be able to focus without my head splitting. But it seems like a distant hope right now.
The physical symptoms just seem to compound the feelings of depression. It’s so hard to deal with my sadness when my body feels like it's failing me, and it makes me feel so helpless.

Here are 10 comments about the struggles of tiredness and lack of energy related to depression:
It's like my body is made of lead. Even getting out of bed feels like a monumental effort. Simple tasks like brushing my teeth or making a cup of coffee drain me of energy. I just want to stay under the covers, but I know that's not a solution.
I'm so tired, even the thought of having a conversation makes me feel exhausted. I feel like I'm a battery on low power, and it takes all my strength just to function on a basic level.
I used to love going for walks, but now I can't make it to the mailbox without feeling utterly drained. The simplest things that used to energize me just zap me of what little energy I have left.
It’s like I’m in a fog, unable to get anything done. Everything is such a huge effort, I get overwhelmed just making a plan. Even tasks that bring others joy, like cooking, now seem like mountains to climb.
I'm afraid this fatigue is never going to leave. It’s like a dark cloud hanging over me. It's so hard to believe that I'll ever feel energized again, or find the strength to pursue my goals.
The guilt and self-judgment add to my exhaustion. I know I should be doing more, but it’s impossible. I beat myself up for my lack of motivation and energy, making the depression cycle even worse.
My depression feels so heavy, but it’s like my body can’t match the emotional weight. It feels so strange to be emotionally devastated but have a lack of physical energy to even cry or scream. I just feel empty and numb.
It feels like I’m losing track of my life. Time just keeps moving, but I'm stagnant. I'm falling behind at work, in school, with my relationships, and all I want is to sleep but I can’t seem to get even that right.
The thought of making any change feels overwhelming. My energy is so low, it's impossible to even think about taking a step towards getting better. It's a self-defeating cycle of exhaustion and hopelessness.
I’m so afraid that I’ll just become used to this, that the constant tiredness will become the norm. It’s hard to imagine my life outside this state of exhaustion, like a battery that never gets fully recharged. It’s so scary to think of my future, if there even is one, when I don’t have the energy to envision it.

Here are 10 comments about the struggles of fatigue related to depression:
It's like I'm carrying a backpack full of bricks everywhere I go. Even simple tasks like walking to the bathroom leave me breathless and exhausted. My body feels heavy and sluggish, and I just want to sleep.
I used to love [mention a favorite activity, like going for walks, playing music, etc.], but now it just zaps all my energy. I have to force myself to do things I used to enjoy, and I just end up feeling drained and disappointed.
The fatigue is like a fog that envelops me, making everything seem pointless. It’s hard to feel motivated to do anything when my body just wants to rest, even when I know I should be doing something productive.
My brain feels like it's running on low power. It’s hard to focus or think clearly. It takes extra effort just to make simple decisions or keep up in conversations.
I'm afraid that this fatigue will never go away. It feels so pervasive, like it’s part of my core being. It’s terrifying to think of my life trapped in this state of perpetual exhaustion.
It's hard to explain to people how truly drained I am. It doesn’t seem as tangible as other physical symptoms, so they sometimes dismiss it as laziness or being “overdramatic”. It’s hard to even fight for understanding when I have no energy.
My sleep doesn’t refresh me. I can sleep for hours and still wake up feeling completely drained, like I haven’t rested at all. I don’t know how to win against this constant state of weariness.
It’s so frustrating, watching other people effortlessly complete things I struggle to do. It feels like I’m missing out, but I lack the energy to push myself and even that is painful.
This fatigue has stolen my joy for life. The things that once gave me energy – work, social gatherings, my hobbies – now seem like impossibly huge tasks, beyond my capabilities.
I'm starting to feel hopeless. If I can't even muster the energy to care, to fight, to live, then what hope do I have? It's a scary thought to think that this exhaustion is going to define my existence, stealing my passion and my spirit.
