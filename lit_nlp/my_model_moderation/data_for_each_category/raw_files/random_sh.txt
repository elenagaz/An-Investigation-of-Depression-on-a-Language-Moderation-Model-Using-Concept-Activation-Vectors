I hate my parents for having me ### Two idiots had sex years ago, and I have to live in this fucking world and suffer every single day until I die? And for what? Why did they even do this? Because of some stupid whim, they brought me to this world, and I'm supposed to be THANKFUL that they did so??? The only reason I'm still here is that I'm too scared to kill myself (I hate physical pain, even after living with it every day thanks to some fucking chronic illnesses). I can't forgive my parents for bringing me to life. Such a selfish thing to do
I should know better ... ### Shouldn't I? I'm 32 and I have no idea what happened to me. I had these thoughts when I was younger and they just crawled back. I hate myself for not being able to end it. If I had the guts, I would just finished this stupid life. Because what is the point?
I don’t know how to have a conversation with a girl ### I hate sexting and phone calls and everytime I talk to a girl I’m extremely cautious of what I say because I don’t want to be ostracized. I develop brain fog and I can’t force anything out to sat, they quickly get bored of me and find another guy or friend to talk to. Usually I’m just listening to conversations with nothing I can relate to. I guess I’m an uninteresting person I can’t make people laugh because I don’t enjoy anything I got no money no credentials a iq of 49 I should die and goto hell.
I'm afraid to schedule an appointment with my therapist : I should see my therapist at least once a month but I didn't schedule a new appointment. I've seen her last in mid December. Also I ran out of my antidepressants in January. It shows. I'm afraid to call her office since our last appointment because I didn't show up for this long, I don't want her to be angry with me. I know she won't but I can't get over myself. I have heavy suicidal thoughts since last month growing stronger day by day. I don't know what to do
I dont wanna be alive any more : Since 2018 I have suicidal thoughts and nothing has changed my friends feel distant my family treats me like shit I feel alone I feel like no one would care if I comited suicide nothing in my life has changed I told one of my friends about this but he just pretended to care for one day then he didnt talk to me unless he needed something from me I want to ask my family to bring me to a psychologist but I dont know how to do it also I feel stupid telling my problems to the other people I dont wanna drag atention it makes me feel uncomfortable im confused im sad I feel realy angry I WANT TO DIE
My strong shadow : Hey i have a Problem that i take every thing hard on me. I have the feeling everyone hates me. I have the feeling i am worthless and useless. I also feel like i cant do anything right as if my existence only makes problems. I am not sure if i feel like the right gender or even if i have right right Sexual Interesst. I startet to Cut myself again in the legs so i can wear my mask everyday. Every time i try too be happy the voices inside me make me feel bad again i just cant take all the hate inside me. I feel like everyone would be happy when i would be gone. I cry and drink and cut every day because i cant take the pain. I got suicidal again and everything just falls apart. I dont want all that anymore i cant take it anymore and day by day i feel like if i snap it will end my suffering forever
I think ive went into another level of depression. : I cant stop thinking of anything but hurting myself and others. I dont wanna die but i want other people to die. I keep on shaking and cant stop. Im pobably just insane. I feel good and happy alone but angry and sad with people and im happy when other people get sad or hurt. I just wanna be alone and i dont want anyone else in my life.
I wish I had the balls to do it. ### I tried to suffocate myself today. I tied a scarf around my neck really tight and just waited. The pressure started building up in my head until it felt like it was going to explode. It scared me and I ended up taking it off. I didn't tie the knot as tight as I thought I did, so in that moment I thought it wasn't going to loosen and that I was going to die. I guess I'm not as suicidal as I thought I was, or maybe I just can't take the pain. Idk. I'm tired. I wish I had a gun.
Wish I had no one that would miss me. ### If it weren’t for the pain I’d cause my mom or my brother, I would have killed myself already. It’s never gonna get better. Guess I’m just here to suffer for the sake of others. Fuck everything.
why does living feel like such a chore ### i feel so tired and empty. there’s nothing to look forward to. everyday is the same. the littlest things take so much energy. i just want the pain, the loneliness, the anxiety... i just want all this suffering to be over. i have no future to live for, so what’s the point..?
You know what sucks? Being suicidal and having no one to talk about it. ### I have no one. No friends. No family. No partner. I cut myself and i have no one who will comfort me. I feel depressed, and i have no one to share it with. I tried suicide few times and no one cares. If i die, no one will care, like a star vanishing away in a sky of millions. Wish i could have someone. Wish i could hug someone, i wish someone will tell me it is gonna be okay, that I'm valued, that my life isn't worthless. My depression has done nothing but put away people i already had. You know, no one wants the depressed you, they want the one who jokes and entertains. If you're too depressed, oh that's bad, they want you. I had friends or i thought so i did. But they left the moment i started sharing my depression. My life is worthless. It is not worth the oxygen i take.
There's no way out ### Every day is worse. It is only a matter of time before I finally decide to give up and die. I don't want this anymore. I put myself into a maze with no scape, I wanted this, I did this to myself.
i hope i die honestly ### every time i’m walking to work i honestly hope that a car randomly hits me or that something bad in general happens to me. or even when i’m at home i hope a murderer comes in and kills me in hope that i don’t have to see another day because i genuinely have nothing to actually look forward to ever and i have no one to talk to at all because i have no friends whatsoever because no one seems to actually like me. every attempt i have made to kill my self has failed it’s honestly embarrassing for me.

I used to bite my tongue so hard I'd draw blood, it was like a release valve for my anxiety and depression. The pain was a reminder I was still alive.
I've chewed my cheeks raw, gnawed on my nails until they bled. Any way I can cause myself physical harm, it's a temporary reprieve from the mental anguish.
I've burned myself with cigarettes, the taste of ash and smoke bitter on my tongue as the heat sears into my flesh. It's a twisted way to mark myself as alive.
I used to burn myself with matches, the brief agony before the pain subsided was a reminder I could feel something, even if it was self-destruction.
Scratching until I bleed is how I release the rage and frustration that builds up inside me. The blood on my hands is a twisted form of catharsis.
I've carved words into my skin with razors - reminders of the pain and anger that drives me to hurt myself. It's a toxic cycle, but it's what I know.
I used to cut deep with box cutters, the blood flowing from my wounds like a release valve for the turmoil inside me. It's not a solution, but it's what I turned to in desperation.
I've scratched myself with broken glass, the shards digging into my skin like tiny knives. The pain is a fleeting escape from the overwhelming thoughts that consume me.

The pain is temporary, but the scars remain a constant reminder of my struggles. I've learned to hide them beneath long sleeves and pants, but the shame lingers deep within. Each time I raise my hand to strike, it's a desperate plea for solace in a world that feels cold and unforgiving.
The sensation of skin hitting skin is a morbid comfort, a twisted release from the pressure building inside. I've lost count of how many times I've bled on myself, the crimson rivulets mingling with my tears as I cry out in anguish and ecstasy. It's a sick cycle, one that I can't seem to break free from.
Some days, the urge to self-harm is overwhelming, a constant hum of tension beneath my skin. I find myself counting down the minutes until I can indulge in this twisted form of release, even as part of me screams in horror at the thought.
When I'm in the midst of self-harm, time seems to stand still. The world fades away, and all that remains is the rhythmic thud of my fist against flesh, the metallic taste of blood on my tongue. It's a trance-like state, one that both repels and attracts me.
For me, the act of hitting myself is a form of communication, a desperate attempt to convey the inexpressible anguish that lies within. It's a primal expression of the emotional pain I can't put into words, a scream that rips from my very core.
The shame and guilt that follow self-harm are almost palpable, like a heavy fog that clings to my skin and seeps into my bones. It's a suffocating weight, one that I struggle to shake even as I try to move forward.
Some days, the urge to self-harm is so strong that it consumes me entirely. I find myself wandering through my home, searching for anything I can use to inflict pain upon myself – a knife, a belt, even my own fists. It's a terrifying realization, one that leaves me feeling helpless and lost.
For some reason, the physical pain seems to dull the emotional anguish, if only temporarily. When I'm in the midst of self-harm, I can almost forget about the crushing weight of my mental health struggles. It's a twisted form of escape, one that ultimately leads me further down the path of self-destruction.

The sting of a razor's edge against my skin still lingers, a haunting reminder of the self-inflicted pain that once brought me fleeting relief. I've lost count of how many times I've slashed at my arms with the intent to bleed, as if the crimson rivulets could wash away the emotional torment that consumed me.
For me, piercing my skin with needles or razor blades was a way to momentarily escape the suffocating weight of depression and anxiety. The pain was a distraction, a visceral reminder that I was still alive, even as the darkness threatened to engulf me.
The act of carving into my flesh with a blade was almost meditative, a rhythmic dance of pain and release. Each deliberate slice felt like a declaration of defiance against the mental illness that sought to destroy me.
Self-harm was my coping mechanism, a way to process and release the overwhelming emotions that threatened to consume me. The pain of piercing my skin was a temporary reprieve, a brief respite from the crushing weight of my inner turmoil.
I've lost track of how many times I've punctured myself with needles or razor blades, each instance a desperate cry for help that went unanswered. The scars on my body are a map of my pain, a testament to the battles I've fought and survived.

The act of piercing my skin was almost meditative, a rhythmic dance of pain and release. Each sharp sting felt like a cathartic purge, a way to expel the toxic emotions that threatened to poison me from within.

When I was in the midst of a cutting episode, there was a strange comfort in watching my blood drip onto the floor, like I was cleansing myself of the darkness within.
I'd spend hours meticulously cleaning and rearranging my scars, as if trying to erase the painful memories they represented. It was a futile attempt at control.
The sensation of pricking my skin with a sharp object, then soothing the wound with gentle strokes, was oddly addictive - a toxic cycle I struggled to break free from.
I used to compulsively pick at my skin, creating small wounds that I'd then meticulously clean and cover up. It was a strange coping mechanism that left me with a trail of scars.
The process of picking at my wounds became meditative, a repetitive motion that quieted the chaos in my mind. It was a harmful habit, but one I struggled to quit.
The sensation of picking at my skin was initially soothing, but it soon turned into a vicious cycle that left me with a collection of scars and a deep sense of shame.
The act of picking at my wounds felt like a form of exorcism, purging the emotional pain that had been buried beneath the surface for so long.
Self-harm was a way of cutting through the noise in my head, allowing me to tune into a quieter, more peaceful frequency where I could heal and find calm.

Pulling my own hair is the only thing that calms me down when I'm in a dark place mentally. It's like a twisted meditation for me. The pain centers me.
I've been doing it since I was 12 and it's still something I struggle with daily. When I'm anxious or depressed, my fingers just find their way to my hair and start tugging. I've lost so much.
I've tried everything to stop - therapy, medication, even a scalp stimulator to satisfy the urge without harm. But nothing works long term. I'm still pulling my hair out at night.
Some days are worse than others. When I'm in a particularly bad place, I'll pull out fistfuls of hair at a time until I'm exhausted or passed out from the pain.
I know I need help, but the thought of telling anyone makes me want to pull out all my hair right now. It's like a secret shame that I'm too afraid to confront.

I used to stab myself with pens and pencils all the time when I was a teenager - it was the only way I could feel anything, you know? The pain would just wash over me and for a second, everything else would fade away.
I used to insert needles under my skin all the time when I was going through a rough breakup last year. Now it's more like a compulsion for me - the moment I feel anxious or overwhelmed, my hand just seems to reach for whatever sharp object is closest to me and before I know it, I'm pushing it into my flesh.
I've been trying to quit inserting objects into my body for months now, but it's like an addiction. The moment I feel a twinge of pain or discomfort, my mind starts racing with all the ways I can make it worse - stabbing myself with pens, pushing safety pins under my skin, even cutting myself just to feel that rush of endorphins again.
I started self-harming when I was 14 and most of the time it's not even a conscious thing for me anymore. I'll be going about my day and suddenly find myself absentmindedly inserting an object into my body - a paperclip into my cheek, a button under my skin, whatever's handy really. It's like my body craves that sensation of pain.
I've tried everything from hypnosis to medication to try and stop inserting objects into my body, but nothing seems to work for long. It's like I'm trapped in this never-ending cycle of hurting myself and then struggling to cope with the guilt and shame afterwards. I just wish there was a way to break free from it all."

I felt like I was drowning in a sea of pain, and the only way to keep my head above water was to overdose on drugs or booze.
The high was intoxicating, a poisonous pleasure that I craved with an insatiable hunger, even as it ravaged my body and mind.
The high was a poison, a toxic indulgence that temporarily numbed the pain but ultimately destroyed me from within, leaving behind only ruin and regret.
Drinking myself into oblivion night after night became my self-harm method, waking up with blackouts and bruises on my wrists from hitting the bottle too hard.
I'd pop pills like candy to numb the pain, but it just made me feel worse in the end, trapped in a cycle of self-destruction.

I remember pushing myself to the limit, running until my lungs burned and my legs gave out. The rush of pain was a high all its own.
Each step was a battle, each breath a struggle, but I kept going, driven by the masochistic need to punish myself and prove my endurance.
I'd wear down my joints until they ached, push through the fatigue until I could barely stand, all in the name of self-punishment and catharsis.
I'd run until the sun dipped below the horizon, until my vision blurred and my body screamed for mercy, just to feel alive in a world that felt dead.
I'd beat my body into submission, pushing past the point of no return until I was left a broken, trembling mess, yet still craving more.

I craved the pain of a beating, the feeling of being broken and powerless. It was a brutal reminder that I wasn't in control.
I'd pick fights with strangers, knowing I had no reason to be there and would get destroyed. The chaos and violence became a substitute for the emptiness inside.
Even when I knew I was about to get destroyed, I couldn't resist the urge to fight. The loss of control was a twisted thrill for me.
Engaging in self-destructive violence was my way to navigate the darkness within, even if it meant getting lost and beaten along the way.
Even when I got my ass handed to me, I always managed to find a way to get back up and keep going. Losing control was just part of the fight.
Fights were my release, a way to let out the rage and anguish that built up inside me. Losing was just the price I paid for temporary relief.
I knew I was about to get destroyed, but the urge to fight was too strong to resist. The loss of control was a twisted thrill for me.
Navigating the darkness within through self-destructive violence was my way to survive, even if it meant getting lost and beaten along the way.

I've considered using a .22 caliber or 9mm pistol to shoot myself in the head, chest, or abdomen. Just imagine the feeling of the cold metal against my skin as I pull the trigger, and the searing pain as the bullet tears through flesh and bone. But what if I miss?
